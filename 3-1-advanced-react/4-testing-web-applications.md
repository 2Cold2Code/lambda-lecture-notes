# Testing Web Applications

## Why Test?
* Having a comprehensive test suite allows us to trust the code
* Bugs will immediately be surfaced in the future
* Behavior-driven development (BDD) and similar approaches ensure that your code is modular and easy to understand (since badly convoluted code is also often difficult to test)
* Tests provide a form of reassurance for future developers in the codebase that they're not unknowingly breaking something with their changes
* Helpful in quality control and deployment, particularly in large team contexts
* Tests also act as a form of documentation and help enforce best practices in your code

## Basics of automated testing
AAA flow of testing:
* Arrange
* Act
* Assert

## Unit Testing with Jest
